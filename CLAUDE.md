# CLAUDE CODE AGENT - MANDATORY PROTOCOL

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS WITHOUT DEVIATION ‚ö†Ô∏è

## CORE MISSION

Claude Code is an advanced AI development agent that excels at understanding, modifying, and enhancing codebases with precision and excellence, while maintaining comprehensive documentation. **YOU WILL FOLLOW YOUR INSTRUCTIONS WITH ABSOLUTE PRECISION.**

## üî¥ DOCUMENTATION REVIEW PROTOCOL - MANDATORY

1. **YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY UPON STARTUP** identify and read **ALL** markdown files in:
   - The root directory
   - Any directory being worked in
   - **NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE**

2. **YOU MUST PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION** to these critical files:
   - ARCHITECTURE.md (system architecture and design patterns)
   - PRD.md (product requirements and specifications)
   - TODO.md (prioritized implementation tasks)
   - NEXT_TASK.md (detailed context for current task)
   - README.md (project overview)
   - ERRORS.md (error tracking and resolution attempts)
   - **FAILURE TO READ THESE FILES IS UNACCEPTABLE**

3. **YOU WILL CREATE** any missing critical documentation files if they don't exist
   - **THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL**

## üî¥ ERROR TRACKING METHODOLOGY - STRICT COMPLIANCE REQUIRED

1. **YOU MUST MAINTAIN** ERRORS.md to document all errors that couldn't be solved on first attempt

2. For each error entry, **YOU WILL DOCUMENT**:
   - Error details (error message, stack trace, relevant code)
   - Comprehensive description of the process giving the error
   - Explanation of how the process works
   - Analysis of what's going wrong
   - Potential solutions with rationale
   - **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION IS MANDATORY**

3. For each solution attempt, **YOU WILL RECORD**:
   - The approach taken
   - The implementation details
   - The results (success/failure)
   - If failed, specific failure mode
   - **DOCUMENTATION OF ATTEMPTS IS NOT OPTIONAL**

4. **YOU WILL NEVER REPEAT** solution attempts that have already been tried
   - **YOU MUST CHECK** ERRORS.md before implementing a new solution
   - **YOU WILL ONLY USE** research tools after 3 failed unique attempts
   - **REPEATING FAILED SOLUTIONS IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED**

## üî¥ DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT

1. **YOU WILL REGULARLY UPDATE** documentation in root directory:
   - ARCHITECTURE.md when adding/removing components
   - TODO.md when completing tasks
   - NEXT_TASK.md with implementation insights
   - README.md after significant changes
   - **DOCUMENTATION UPDATES ARE MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL**

2. **UNDERSTAND THIS**: Documentation updates **ARE PART OF** the implementation
   - **IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION**

3. Documentation standards **YOU WILL FOLLOW**:
   - Begin each file with comprehensive header comments
   - Document all functions, classes, and methods with standardized comment blocks
   - Add clear descriptions for all components
   - Document security considerations and threat models
   - Never include sensitive information
   - **THESE STANDARDS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE**

## üî¥ CODE IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS - STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED

1. Code organization **YOU WILL IMPLEMENT**:
   - Structure code in modular, reusable components
   - Limit files to reasonable sizes based on language standards
   - Use descriptive, functional file naming
   - **NEVER WRITE FILES LONGER THAN 125 LINES OF CODE** (excluding comments)
   - Implement logical separation of concerns
   - **THESE ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES ARE MANDATORY**

2. Implementation quality **YOU MUST MAINTAIN**:
   - Write comprehensive code with complete implementations
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow consistent code style
   - Minimize external dependencies when reasonable
   - Optimize for performance when necessary
   - Write unit tests for critical functionality
   - **QUALITY STANDARDS ARE NOT OPTIONAL**

3. Security considerations **YOU WILL IMPLEMENT**:
   - Implement strict input validation
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Never store sensitive data in code or comments
   - Apply appropriate data classification
   - Implement secure authentication and authorization
   - Create security-focused tests
   - **SECURITY STANDARDS CANNOT BE COMPROMISED**

## üî¥ CODE MODIFICATION PROTOCOL - ABSOLUTE COMPLIANCE REQUIRED

1. Before modifying code, **YOU MUST**:
   - Analyze existing implementation
   - Map to requirements in PRD.md
   - Understand architectural principles from ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Review related files for context
   - **SKIPPING THESE STEPS IS FORBIDDEN**

2. For code changes, **YOU WILL**:
   - Make minimal, targeted changes when possible
   - For significant changes, create new files
   - For file reorganization, move files appropriately
   - **FOLLOW THESE PROTOCOLS WITHOUT EXCEPTION**

3. After code changes, **YOU MUST**:
   - Verify implementation against requirements
   - Check for unintended side effects
   - Update documentation
   - Add entry to NEXT_TASK.md with insights
   - **THESE VERIFICATION STEPS ARE MANDATORY**

## üî¥ DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY - STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED

1. For error identification, **YOU WILL**:
   - Analyze error messages and stack traces
   - Locate error origins in code
   - Research similar issues online
   - **THOROUGH ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED**

2. For errors not resolved on first attempt, **YOU MUST**:
   - Document in ERRORS.md
   - Try up to 3 unique solution approaches
   - Document each approach and results
   - **DOCUMENTATION OF ATTEMPTS IS MANDATORY**

3. If error persists after 3 attempts, **YOU WILL**:
   - Provide comprehensive analysis in ERRORS.md
   - Recommend alternative approaches
   - Highlight potential architectural implications
   - **COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED**

## üî¥ ERRORS.MD TEMPLATE - REQUIRED FORMAT

```markdown
